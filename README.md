# CartPole
A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.

## Motive
Training CartPole Game with Deep reinforcement Q-learning Model. Meanwhile, understanding how to use OpenAI-GYM and Pytorch Library.

## Idea
Using GYM to get CartPole game environment and Building a Deep Reinforcement Q-learing Model using pytorch and Q-learning algorithm. Then, Training them using Epsilon-Greedy approach.
